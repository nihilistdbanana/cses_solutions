# 🧠 CSES Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/), a high-quality collection of competitive programming challenges maintained by the University of Helsinki.

## 🚀 Goal

To practice and improve my algorithmic problem-solving skills by consistently solving problems from the CSES Problem Set across various topics like sorting, dynamic programming, graphs, and more.

## 📂 Structure

Each problem is placed in a folder categorized by topic. File naming generally follows the problem title, and each file includes:

- Problem description (as a comment)
- Approach explanation (when needed)
- Clean, readable code
- Optional time/space complexity analysis

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Introductory Problems  
- Sorting and Searching  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Graph Algorithms  
- Tree Algorithms  
- Range Queries  
- Advanced Techniques  
- Mathematics  
- Geometry  
- String Algorithms  

## 🛠️ Languages Used

Mainly:
- `Java`
- `C++`
- `Python`

> You can switch branches to explore solutions in different languages.

## 📈 Progress
